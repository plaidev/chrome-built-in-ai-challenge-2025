Speaker 1:
Hi Mr. Johnson, thank you for coming in today. I’m Emily White, and I’ll be assisting you.

Speaker 1:
I understand you and your family—three of you—will be in Paris from November 10th to 17th, and you’re looking for local activities. I heard your son is in 4th grade and this will be his first trip to Europe.

Speaker 2:
That’s right. We want him to have a memorable experience.

Speaker 1:
Of course. I’d recommend a mix of sightseeing and fun local experiences—like visiting the Eiffel Tower, taking a Seine River cruise, and joining a French pastry-making class together. Disneyland Paris is also a great option for families.

Speaker 2:
That sounds great. He’d love Disneyland, and the pastry class sounds fun for all of us.

Speaker 1:
If you’d like to explore beyond the city, a day trip to Mont Saint-Michel is another great choice. The island’s medieval abbey makes it enjoyable for both kids and adults. All of these activities are generally around $200 per person.

Speaker 2:
That’s perfect. So Paris sightseeing, Disneyland, the pastry class, and maybe Mont Saint-Michel.

Speaker 1:
Exactly. I’ll prepare a few personalized activity plans for your week in Paris with the budget in mind.

Speaker 2:
That would be great—thank you so much!
